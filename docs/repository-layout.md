# Repository Layout

The repository is organized by responsibility, not by programming language.

## Initial Layout

```text
repo/
├─ AGENTS.md
├─ README.md
├─ .github/
├─ docs/
├─ data/
├─ engine/
├─ tools/
├─ apps/
├─ .clang-format
└─ .clang-tidy
```

## Responsibilities

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent working rules |
| `README.md` | Project entry point |
| `.github/` | Pull request templates and CI workflows |
| `docs/` | Architecture, progress, layout, style, and review documents |
| `data/` | Dataset manifest policy, evaluation artifact policy, and local-only data placement |
| `engine/` | Native C++ Othello engine static library |
| `tools/` | Developer and validation command-line tools |
| `apps/` | User-facing applications |
| `.clang-format` | C++ formatting rules |
| `.clang-tidy` | C++ static analysis rules |

## Documentation Layout

Documentation is indexed from `docs/README.md`.

Architecture documents describe intended boundaries, semantics, and invariants.

Progress documents describe current implementation state, milestones, benchmark
notes, temporary gaps, and deferred work.

Progress documents must not redefine architecture.

```text
docs/
├─ README.md
├─ architecture/
├─ progress/
├─ repository-layout.md
└─ cpp-coding-style.md
```

## Engine Layout

The engine owns Othello rules and state transitions. It builds as a static
library. Human-facing executable entry points live in `tools/` or `apps/`;
engine-specific benchmark executables and benchmark management scripts live
under `engine/benchmarks/`.

```text
engine/
├─ README.md
├─ benchmarks/
│  ├─ baselines/
│  ├─ results/
│  └─ scripts/
├─ fixtures/
├─ include/
├─ src/
└─ tests/
   └─ support/
```

Engine tests use Catch2 and run through CTest.
`engine/tests/` owns test sources and test-only helpers. Shared test-only
helpers live in `engine/tests/support/` and are linked only by test targets.

`engine/fixtures/` owns checked-in data shared by tests, benchmarks, and golden
generation scripts. Keep reusable validation corpora and expected-output files
there instead of under `engine/tests/` when non-test executables also consume
them.

`engine/benchmarks/` owns the benchmark suite: C++ benchmark executables,
checked-in aggregate baselines, ignored local result scratch files, and
golden/baseline helper scripts. Benchmark helper scripts are part of the engine
benchmark suite, not generic top-level tools.

## Data Layout

`data/` owns repository policy and manifests for pattern-learning inputs and
evaluation artifacts.

```text
data/
├─ corpora/
│  ├─ README.md
│  ├─ dataset-manifest.schema.json
│  └─ samples/
└─ eval/
   └─ README.md
```

Raw third-party corpora, derived datasets, learned binary weights, and large
generated artifacts stay out of normal git history. Checked-in manifests and
tiny synthetic samples are allowed when they contain no restricted payload data
and no personal local paths.

## Tools Layout

Tools link against engine libraries and provide small command-line entry points
for development, smoke checks, and validation. Keep this area focused on
human-run development CLIs rather than benchmark suite management scripts.

```text
tools/
├─ data-policy/
├─ data-import/
├─ pattern-features/
├─ arena/
│  ├─ openings/
│  └─ README.md
├─ engine-cli/
│  └─ main.cc
└─ engine-smoke/
   └─ main.cc
```

## Apps Layout

Applications live under apps/.

The current repository has only the applications README. Add application
subdirectories here as user-facing apps are introduced.

```text
apps/
└─ README.md
```
